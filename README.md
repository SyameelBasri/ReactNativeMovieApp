# ReactNativeMovieApp

The app allows users to create a list of their favorite movies or shows. All the data on the movies/shows are from a public API called OMDb API. Users are able to search for movies/shows and add them into their favorite list. Users can also create their own personal note about their favorite movies, which then will be stored in the JSON server as the movie object’s properties. To allow the data to be persisted, the favorite list is stored into a JSON server. As the app has two sources of data, it will be warped by two Provider. One for data from OMDb API and one for data from JSON server. 

The app overall contains four screens. Home screen, search results screen, movie details screen, edit movie’s note screen. Home screen displays the user’s favorite movies’ posters and names in a grid layout of two columns. The search results screen is divided into pages where each page contains a maximum of 10 results. The results can be further filtered by types or years. Movie details screen has information on its rated, runtime, genre and plot. It also has a heart button for users to add the movie into their favorite list. The personal note can only be seen once the user adds the movie into their favorite. When users unfavorites a movie, its personal note will also be deleted.
